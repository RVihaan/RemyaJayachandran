# VSDsquadron-mini-internship
The VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V development board 
>> Core Processor - The board is powered by CH32V003F4U6 chip with 32-bit RISC-V core based on RV32EC instruction set, optimized for high-performance computing with support for 2-level interrupt nesting and supports 24MHz system main frequency in the product function
>>  Clock and Reset Systems: Includes a built-in factory-trimmed 24MHz RC oscillator and a 128kHz RC oscillator, plus an external 24MHz oscillator option for varied clocking requirements
>> Robust GPIO Support: Boasts 3 groups of GPIO ports, totaling 15 I/O ports, enabling extensive peripheral connections and mapping to external interrupt capabilities
>> Flexible Communication Interfaces: Offers multiple communication protocols including USART, I2C, and SPI for versatile connectivity options
>> High-Speed Memory: Equipped with 2KB SRAM for volatile data storage, 16KB CodeFlash for program memory, and additional 1920B for bootloader functionalities
