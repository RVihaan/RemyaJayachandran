Day 1:

1.  **Introduction to IC package, chip, pads, core and IPs**

Integrated Circuits (ICs) are fundamental to modern electronic devices,
from smart phones to advanced computing systems. Understanding the
structure and function of ICs is to appreciate how electronic devices
operate at a fundamental level. The key components of ICs include their
packaging, chips, pads, core, and Intellectual Properties (IPs) etc.

Arduino microcontroller board : The highlighted section illustrates the
microprocessor (chip) which is connected to other elements on the board.
The design process of this chip, from an abstract level to its final
fabrication, is carried out using the RTL to GDSII flow. Arduino
encompasses both a programmable physical circuit board, commonly known
as a microcontroller, and a software component known as the IDE
(Integrated Development Environment). This software operates on a
computer and is used to create and transfer code to the physical board.
